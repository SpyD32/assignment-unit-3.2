// Example: a for loop to console.log numbers from 0 to 3
// console.log('count from 0 to 3');
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
// console.log('count from 0 to 3');

// start i at 0, while i is < 4 do code between {}, afterwards add 1 to i (i++)


// 1.a. TODO: Write a for loop to console.log the numbers from 0 to 5 
//   - Which part of the example loop do you need to change to do this?
for (let i = 0; i<=5; i++) {
  // console.log(i);
//the expression is what needs to be changed. 
  
}

// 1.b. TODO: Write a for loop to console.log the numbers from 3 to 5
//   - Which part of the example loop do you need to change to do this?
//for the example loop to be changed, it would be let i = 3; instead of

for (let i = 3; i <=5; i++) {
  //  console.log('count from 3 to 5');
}


// 1.c. TODO: Write a for loop to console.log EVEN numbers from 2 to 10
//   - Which part of the example loop do you need to change to do this?
for (let i = 2; i <=10; i++) {
let even = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
//coding after the condition you are able to add another veriable for even numbers.

// 2. For of loops  
// console.log('---- 2. For Of loop ----');
let stars = ['Polaris', 'Gacrux', 'Formalhaut', 'Rigel', 'Deneb']
for (let char of stars) {
  // console.log(char);
  //looked up to see why char was used but didn't see an explanation. Might need better explanation to understand the concept. 
}

// 2.a. TODO: Write a for of loop to console.log each star in the 'stars' array
// console.log('Some stars:');


// 3. While loops  
// console.log('---- 3. While loop ----');
//as long as the condition is true, the while loop will keep going until it's not true. 
//therefore if the statement continues to be true there will be an infinite loop. 

// 3.a. TODO: Write a while loop to console.log each star in the 'stars' array
// console.log('Some stars using while:');
  while(stars)

  


// 3.b. TODO: Write a while loop to console.log the numbers from 0 to 5
// console.log('count from 0 to 5');

  

// 3.c. TODO: Write a while loop to console.log the numbers from 10 to 5
// console.log('count backwards from 10 to 5');
